Features I did not complete: none! I did them all.

Game objects I did NOT use from the internet/unity asset store/itchio are :
	- all C# scripts
	- all trees
	- all bushes
	- animation implementation
	- entire game structure 
	- entire development of game 

	...aka everything except some of the sprite sheets...
